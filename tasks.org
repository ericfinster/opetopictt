** Normalizing positions

So, here's an idea: you could have a separate value universe for the
position types.  I think the typing might just work out.  The reason
this might be useful is that it would make clear that the
normalization algorithm was working.  Indeed.  It might even be
possible to enforce some kind of normal forms.  This is worth
thinking about ...

So, for example, what can actually occur on the left of a sum?  Not a
sum.  Oh, as a warmup, you could just do natural numbers ...

((1 + 1) + 1)

(a * (1 + 1 + 1 + 1)) + (b * 0) + c * (1 + 1) 
a * b + c * d + 1 + 1 + 1

So we see that the normal forms are sums of products of variables,
with some constants at the end.  Oh, yikes.  But then this will not
have normal forms unless we choose an ordering on the variables....

Okay, this is going to be a good exercise.  Fun, fun.
